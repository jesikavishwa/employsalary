Project 2:oops

In this project,I create "Employ salary" interface in which I declare the net_salary calculation and then create superclass which implements interface and in superclass , I declare get and set methods for name and id. Then I create subclass extending superclass and in that subclass, I declare get set methods for basic_pay,hra and da and then calculate annual_salary calculation, income tax checking and 
display function. and then define the interface function "net salary calculation" by overriding it.

Then create the class "EmployTest" in which the object for the subclass is created.
